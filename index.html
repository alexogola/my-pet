    <h1>My pet dog</h1>
    <p>Many people keep dogs as pets. I too have a <strong>pet dog</strong>. My dog belongs to <em>Pomerian breed</em>.<br> it is white in colour. I call it Max. His body is covered with soft, white fur.<br>Max is small, active, smart and runs very fast.</p>
    <h2>I love my dog</h2>
    <p>I love my pet dog. I take great <strong>care of it</strong> and give him bath.<br>Every morning I take him out for walk. Thus I too am able to have a walk every morning. I feel my dog <em>personally</em>.<br> I give him biscuits, bread and milk and an egg every day, and twice a week I give him meat.</p>
